Why I did that
==============
######while working for my <a href="http://ekshitij.com">Group</a>...
######I just not wanted to have Captcha's there...
######So, this is an alternate solution...atleast random email are not going to submit.
<hr>
######and before some days, when my friend created his first website..
######then I was just filling random email's and submitting them to sign-up there.
######then he introduced Captcha's and my JS-script-bot was just unable to make it.
######So, it could also be a solution to his problem also.
